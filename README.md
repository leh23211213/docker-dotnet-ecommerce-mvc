## 6. Database Schema
- **Database**: The project uses SQL Server as the database.
- **Approach**: The project is developed using the **Database First** approach, where the database schema is used to generate the data models.
- **Fluent API**: The database configurations and relationships are managed using the Fluent API, located in the `./src/Data/Configuration` directory. This allows precise control over how the entities and their relationships are mapped to the database schema.
- **Description**: The main tables include entities such as `Users`, `Products`, `Orders`, and `OrderDetails`. Relationships between these entities are defined using Fluent API configurations.
- **Migrations**: Although the project uses the Database First approach, any updates to the database schema should be followed by updating the models and Fluent API configurations.
